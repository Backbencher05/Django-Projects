"""
- create project
- start app
- create model
    use field:
        photo upload_to='myimage' upload in this folder(install pillow library)
        date
- makemigration 
- migrate
- create admin

we are able to upload the image , but when we click we get error

# to access it 
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

print(static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
)

"""


# Now if you want to define the root for every media file
# - go to settings.py 

# MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media' (new folder will create in base DIR/'myimage' 

# normally we get the URL like this  
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/myimage/images.jpg
# If you want to give paricular URL than 
# go to settings.py
# MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
# Now: http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/myimage/images.jpg


# Now let's use this concept to build our image uploader project
